## Motives and Background
I really like football news and I always pay attention to the standings especially in the five most popular leagues in continental Europe such as the Bundesliga, Premier League, Serie A, Primera Division and ligue 1. In the beginning I was very lazy to access any official website from the five most popular leagues in Europe one by one. Because of that I got the idea to create a rest api program to access the data base from outside so that I could easily get information from each of the five most popular soccer leagues on the European continent.

## Project Duration
I made this rest api program in 3 days because I learned about fire rest first and after that I started to manage and develop the data through the program that I created.

## The Code's Structure


## Class and Function Interface


## Statistic
I wrote 182 line of codes by myself in EuropeanSoccerLeagueStandingsAPI.ipynb file.
